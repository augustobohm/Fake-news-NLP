# Fake and Real News Classifier
This repository contains Python code for a Fake and Real News Classifier. The code is designed to classify news articles as either fake or real, based on a dataset from a Kaggle competition. The Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are implemented using the following tools:

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Used for numerical computing and array operations.
Seaborn: Used for data visualization and creating informative plots.
Matplotlib: Used for creating plots and charts.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Used for various NLP tasks such as text preprocessing and tokenization.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the [Fake and Real News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) from Kaggle. It consists of news articles categorized as fake or real. The dataset provides text data along with the corresponding labels.
